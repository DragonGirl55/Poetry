The flowers are closing
As if a spell cast
The sunlight is falling
It's evening at last

For some, the night isn't
A place they have known
But I find it peaceful
When I sit alone

The stars do not judge
And the crickets sing low
And in winter I wonder
Will I wake to snow?

I can do what I wish
Without schedules or times
In day I help others
But nighttime is mine
